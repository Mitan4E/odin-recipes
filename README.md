# odin-recipes
I will be creating a website that will consist of an index page which will have links to a few recipes. 
It will not be extremely advanced and will require some of the basic html that I have learnt so far. 
I will be revisiting this project in the future to style my website using CSS. 
I mainly want to learn how git works and get some practise using it, especially with commiting. Hopefully this project will teach me and help me get the hang of it!
