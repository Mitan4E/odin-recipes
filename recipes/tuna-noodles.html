        <h4>Tuna Noodles</h4>

        <p>
            Canned tuna is tossed with chopped tomatoes, olives, red onions, capers, 
            parsley, olive oil and lemon juice, and then tossed again with hot fusilli 
            pasta and shredded mozzarella cheese. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Although it's mainly associated with Middle America, and the 1950s housewife, the earliest 
            printed recipes for tuna noodles appeared two decades earlier in the Pacific Northwest.
